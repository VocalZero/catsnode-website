### Welcome 👋 
Behind this project are some young people who worked on [atomicnetworks](https://github.com/atomicnetworkseu) back then and now want to stay up to date with digital projects while working or going to school.
That's why we founded this small test environment for us which we are making available to you here free of charge so that you too can use it for your own purposes.

**If you click [here](https://github.com/InstabilSpielt/catsno.de/wiki) you will find all the information about how to integrate the project in your environment.<br>
It's really simple, at least we hope so. 😊**

### This project currently includes 📚
<b>/audio</b> • We wanted to present all the information provided by RadioBOSS as nicely as possible without having to program a big wrapper (as we did [here](https://github.com/atomicnetworkseu/atomicradio-api/tree/update/radioboss) at atomicradio), so we decided to use the already existing reporting and process everything in one environment.
